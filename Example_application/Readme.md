This folder contains a simple example of a potential dataset for analysis. This dataset is artificial - with real trends. In this folder you'll find:

- A dataset (in the form of a spreadsheet)
- A jupyter notebook containing some questions and suggestions (this is in the style of a small piece of coursework)
- A jupyter notebook with some "model answers"

This is adapted from a piece of coursework given to MSc Pharmaceutics students studying the module "Computational Pharmaceutics" at UCL.
